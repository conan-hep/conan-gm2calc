## For users

### Installation of dependencies

GM2Calc can be installed with conan by running:

    conan install GM2Calc/1.7.2@conan/stable

Alternatively a `conanfile.txt` file can be created in your project
directory with the following content:

    [requires]
    GM2Calc/1.7.2@conan/stable

    [generators]
    cmake
    make
    pkg_config

The dependencies of your project are then installed by running:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    conan install ..

### Building your project

Afterwards the project can be configured via CMake and build with
`make` by running:

    cmake ..
    make

Alternatively the project can be configured with Meson and build with
`ninja` by running:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=.
    meson ..
    ninja

Alternatively the project can be build with `make` by running:

    make -f ../Makefile

A complete example can be found in the `examples/` directory.


## Build and package

The following command both runs all the steps of the conan file, and
publishes the package to the local system cache.  This includes
downloading dependencies from "build_requires" and "requires" , and
then running the build() method.

    $ conan create . GM2Calc/1.7.2@conan/stable
